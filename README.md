# Quadcopter-Prototype
This project is a ground-up quadcopter prototype focused on building and validating the core control stack needed for stable flight from scratch. The main goal was to connect motor outputs to sensor feedback and test a closed-loop stabilization approach before moving to full-frame integration.
